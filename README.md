# Cloud Minecraft Server (Terraform & OCI)

A fully automated, "out-of-the-box" Minecraft server deployment on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) using Terraform.

## 🚀 Features
*   **Zero-Cost Capable**: Optimized for OCI "Always Free" Arm instances.
*   **One-Click Deploy**: Automated PowerShell script handles infrastructure-as-code.
*   **Auto-Configured**: Sets up Java, PaperMC, Firewalls, and System Services automatically.
*   **Management API**: Includes a lightweight HTTP API to Start/Stop the server remotely.
*   **Mod Support**: Automatically uploads and installs mods from a local folder.

## 📂 Project Structure
*   `easy_deploy.ps1`: The main automation script.
*   `steps.md`: **Detailed setup guide.** READ THIS FIRST!
*   `infrastructure/`: Contains Terraform code configuration.
*   `server_mods/`: (Optional) folder for your .jar mods.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Configure Credentials
You need your OCI API Keys and OCIDs.
1.  Place your OCI Private Key in `infrastructure/ter_keys/private_ter.pem`.
2.  Update `infrastructure/terraform.tfvars` with your `tenancy_ocid`, `user_ocid`, `fingerprint`, and `region`.

### 2. Deploy
Run the automation script in PowerShell:

```powershell
.\easy_deploy.ps1
```

This will:
1.  Check/Generate SSH keys for the server.
2.  Provision VCN, Subnets, and Firewall rules.
3.  Create the VM and install Minecraft (PaperMC).
4.  Upload any mods found in `server_mods/`.
5.  Wait for the server to be ready.

### 3. Play
*   **Connect**: Use the IP Address displayed at the end of the script.
*   **Manage**: Use the provided `Invoke-RestMethod` commands to Start/Stop the server via the API (Port 8080).

## 🛠️ Customization
Edit `infrastructure/terraform.tfvars` to change:
*   **Hardware**: `vm_ocpus` (Default: 1), `vm_memory_gbs` (Default: 6)
*   **Game**: `mc_gamemode`, `mc_difficulty`, `mc_level_seed`, `mc_online_mode`

## ⚠️ Destruction
To delete all resources and stop potential billing:

```powershell
cd infrastructure
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```
